## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Survey not visible to students
**Solution:** Check `target_audience` is set to `student`, `students`, or `all`

### Issue: File upload fails
**Solution:** 
1. Check Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
2. Restart backend server
3. Check file size < 10MB
4. Check file type is allowed

### Issue: Cannot submit survey
**Solution:**
1. Check all required questions are answered
2. Check you haven't already submitted (unless multiple submissions allowed)
3. Check survey is active and within date range

### Issue: Duplicate submission error
**Solution:** This is expected if `allow_multiple_submissions` is false. Delete previous response in database or enable multiple submissions.
